Hi, I am a machine learning engineer at G-Research in London. Previously, I obtained MSc in Statistics at ETH Zurich and BEng in Systems Innovation at the University of Tokyo.

My passion lies in the field of machine learning, and I particularly enjoy improving machine learning algorithms by leveraging the underlying mathematical structures of the problems. Especially, keywords that often get me excited include probabilistic modeling, decision making, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, sample efficiency, and uncertainty quantification.

When I'm not tinkering with algorithms, you may find me outside, running or playing tennis. From time to time, I also revisit hobbies from my past, such as cycling, hiking, swimming, and bouldering.
