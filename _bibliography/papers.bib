  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new stochastic optimization algorithm for Bayesian inference based on multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods. In Bayesian statistics, biased estimators of the model evidence have been often used as stochastic objectives because the existing debiasing techniques are computationally costly to apply. To overcome this issue, we apply an MLMC sampling technique to construct low-variance unbiased estimators both for the model evidence and its gradient. In the theoretical analysis, we show that the computational cost required for our proposed MLMC estimator to estimate the model evidence or its gradient with a given accuracy is an order of magnitude smaller than those of the previously known estimators. Our numerical experiments confirm considerable computational savings compared to the conventional estimators. Combining our MLMC estimator with gradient-based stochastic optimization results in a new scalable, efficient, debiased inference algorithm for Bayesian statistical models.}

  abstract = {We study policy evaluation of offline contextual bandits subject to unobserved confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given uncertainty set. However, existing work often resorts to some coarse relaxation of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value. It can be shown that our estimator contains the recently proposed sharp estimator by Dorn and Guo (2022) as a special case, and our method enables a novel extension of the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence. To construct our estimator, we leverage the kernel method to obtain a tractable approximation to the conditional moment constraints, which traditional non-sharp estimators failed to take into account. In the theoretical analysis, we provide a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no specification error that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we provide consistency guarantees of policy evaluation and learning. In the experiments with synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},
